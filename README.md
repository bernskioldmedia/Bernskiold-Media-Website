== Bernskiold Media Website Repo ==
We have decided to open source and post all of our website theme code and custom plugin code in this public GitHub repository.

Most of the website builds upon our already pubicly released Ilmenite Framework and we have really nothing private or confidential about the theme and plugin code themselves.

If this can give you some inspiration in your projects, or if you can find a code snippet that helps you, then be our guest! We'd of course love if you let us know (info@bernskioldmedia.com) or even gave us some credit in your code.
